The other options—\"middle\", which splits each node at its midpoint along the split axis, \"equal\", which splits the current group of primitives into two equal-sized sets, and \"hlbvh\", which selects the HLBVH algorithm, which parallelizes well—are slightly more efficient to evaluate at tree construction time, but lead to substantially lower-quality hierarchies."
